# EGCDayZ


Admin collaberation for the EGCDayZ Server files.

Install https://desktop.github.com/

log into the app

Once logged in goto https://github.com/lilkev2477/EGCDayZ and make sure that you are using the 'Testing' branch instead of 'Master' then find the green tab to clone to desktop. Save it to a folder that you will remember to work in for this or future projects. 

Using the app, you can open and edit the file using a text editor, I use https://code.visualstudio.com/ or notepad++.

Save after editing and goto the github app. On the very top middle of the app you can either save and upload the changes you made by using 'changes' and adding a summary and description. OR view recent changes by others under the 'changes tab'. It will show all changes done buy other collaborators. This will help to keep track of changes and who made them. 

Please work together to collab on all changes to make them reasonable for what the upcoming update has to offer.

I suggest working on a few catagories at a time so everyone else can collab on them and then move on.

Make sure you are using the TESTING branch for all work. Keep the master for current server settings. Dont touch master.

Ill make these more simple later once I have more time. Kev
